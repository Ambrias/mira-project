## How to install

There are many ways that you can install the firmware, you will have to choose an option that suites your use case. The typical install will be done via a WebKit exploit via the web browser.

### WebKit (Web Browser Install) Non-Permanent

This will involve using a WebKit userland exploit, and then elevating to kernel to install the MiraCFW. The changes will be lost upon reboot, but should survive sleep mode.

### Permanent Install

There is not permanent install options at this time, nor will one be offered in the near future.
