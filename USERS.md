# Mira Users Guide
This user guide will help you build, install and use the Mira Framework on your Playstation 4 console.

## How to install
You can install Mira firmware via several methods. You should choose the method that works best for you. Typically, this will be via a webkit exploit in the web browser.

### Webkit exploit (non-permanent installation)
This involves using a webkit userland exploit to elevate the kernel to install MiraCFW. The changes will be lost upon reboot, but should survive sleep mode.

### Permanent installation
There is no permanent install option at this time, nor will one be offered in the near future.
